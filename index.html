        <p class="lead mb-4">Amelia Amador is a driven, hard-working psychology student who aims to eventually work as a school psychologist. She is currently working to complete her undergraduate degree. While she currently does not have work experience in the mental health field, she does have experience from her personal life. Growing up, she was responsible for caring for her mother who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, and more. She was responsible for making sure her mother took all of her medications, calmed her down when she was having manic episodes, led her in creative activities to keep her stress levels down, while also, cleaning and cooking for her.  <br><br>

        Aside from her experience with mental health, she is a perfectionist when it comes to her work. She takes pride in how detailed she create her work to be. She believe that while speed plays a huge role in getting the job done, it is a lot more important to create elaborate and meaningful work than to rush.   <br><br>

        She is also a team-player. Wherever Amelia is needed, she will be there to help. Oftentimes, she is able to befriend her coworkers which only adds to the quality of her work. she believes that having great chemistry between coworkers sets a nice rhythm in the workplace and allows for stronger work to be put out. She is also able to work well independently on top of being part of a group. While, some work gets done well by a group, other tasks are done more efficiently independently. She is very flexible and willing to be put wherever the need is. Oftentimes, she will stay at work later or pick up extra shifts simply because she is flexible and the fact that she prioritizes her work. She enjoys helping people and making sure that everyone she encounters feels welcomed. She believes strongly in hospitality and emphasizes a clean workspace as well as ensuring that everyone's needs are met. <br><br>
